    # Renode 1.17's GPIOTE model misses the first press on a pin that rests high,
    # such as this active-low button. One press and release after boot gets it past
    # that. The firmware never sees it, which the first Assert LED State below checks.

*** Test Cases ***
Should Turn The LED On When sw0 Is Pressed
